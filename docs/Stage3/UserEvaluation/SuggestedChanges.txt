Changes made after User Evaluation:

1. Among the 5 object interaction methods, 1 was chosen and then changed according to user feedback.

2. Load/Delete buttons were too close to the stored scenes dropdown menu. After seeing several mistakes due to this, the buttons were pushed further below.

3. Some users found text inside menus difficult to read, so global menu size was increased 20%.
