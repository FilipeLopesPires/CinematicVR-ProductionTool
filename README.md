## Description:

Idea: to develop a tool that can be used by VR artists for the creation of scenarios and capture of virtual 360 videos.

Purpose: provide means to study whether artists should create in traditional 2D environments or benefit from creating inside 3D space.

Goal: to implement fundamental features that prove the concept.

Tools Used:
- Unity Engine
- Oculus Quest Integration
- Visual Studio Code
- Android Debugging Bridge
- Mixed Reality Toolkit
- TextMesh Pro
- VR Cinema Package
- Skeleton / Orb 3D Models

## Repository Structure:

/docs     - project documentation (presentations, reports and manuals)

/src      - source code (Unity project, packages, etc.)

/licenses - applicable licenses

## Implemented Features:

- Locomotion: walking + teleportation
- Interaction: spawn/delete, point, select/grab (near + far), translate, rotate, scale

- UI: “hand-palette” style, follows hand, only appears when desired
- Inventory: static objects, virtual virtual cameras, lighting

- Recording: 360 panorama image sequences

- Collaboration: save + load scene files

## User Evaluation:

Method:
- Goal: determine how easy it is to interact w/ system
- Persona addressed: 3D artist / content creator
- Tasks: (1) choosing best manipulation, (2) building something
- 8 participants (3 women, 3 experienced w/ VR, 18-55 y.o.)
- Post-task (subjective/opinion) questions

Results:
- Quantitative Analysis: all tasks execution time 5:35-18:33min; avg. time w/ controllers 8-9min; avg. time w/ hands 9-10min.
- Qualitative Analysis:	experienced users take far more advantage; hand tracking is a bit slower but “more satisfying”.

## Future Work:

- [ ] Cardboard Support (including hotspot placement and eye-gazing)

- [ ] Multiplayer Mode

- [ ] Inventory Upgrade (animated 3D objects, Sounds, Upload feature)

- [ ] In-Game Text Editing

- [ ] VR Drawing
