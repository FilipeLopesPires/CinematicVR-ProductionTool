.SYNOPSIS
    Adds version metadata to the MRTK prior to building and packagine.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script represents a step in the build process where certain version
    metadata is added to specific locations in the code, such that the ultimately
    generated binaries and .unitypackages are correctly marked with the right
    metadata.

    In particular, this script will add:
    
    - Version.txt (to specific directories within the MRTK Assets/ folder)
      This is primarily useful for .unitypackage distributions for consumers to be
      able to quickly understand the version they are using.
    - AssemblyInfo.cs (as a sibling in all folders that contain an asmdef file)
      This is primarily useful for binary distribution (so that the generated DLLs
      will be appropriately marked with version numbers and company/origin
      information)
      If AssemblyInfo.cs already exists, this will instead just add the version
      information to the file.

    This will also validate that some project specific versioning to ensure that
    it matches the passed in version (i.e. the version values in
    ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset, which are ultimately not consumed by
    consumers, but should stay in sync for consistency's sake)

    A generaly note on how to update the version values:
    There are three locations to update:
    pipelines/config/settings.yml (MRTKVersion)
    ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset (bundleVersion, metroPackageVersion)

    They should have the same value (except metroPackageVersion which will contain
    one more trailing .0 value)
.EXAMPLE
    .\versiondata.ps1 -Directory c:\path\to\mrtkroot -Version 2.5.0

    # and ProjectSettings/ folder).
