> [!NOTE]
> This installation checks (when the application starts) if the AR Foundation components are in the scene. If not, they are automatically added to make it work with ARCore and ARKit.
> If you need to set a specific behaviour, you should add the components you need by yourself. 
> For more information about AR Foundation components and installation, check this [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@2.2/manual/index.html#samples).

## Building a scene for Android and iOS devices

1. Make sure you have added the UnityAR Camera Settings Provider to your scene.

1. Switch platform to either Android or iOS in the Unity Build Settings

    When you switch the platform you should see the MRTK Project Configurator Window with settings for your chosen platform.  Click Apply to enable platform specific settings.

1. There are no additional steps after switching the platform for Android.

1. If the platform is iOS, Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings, under the Optimization header, **uncheck** Strip Engine Code

    ![iOS Settings](../Images/CameraSystem/UncheckStripEngineCodeiOS.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Unchecking Strip Engine Code is the short term solution to an error in Xcode [#6646](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/6646).  We are working on a long term solution.

1. Build and run the scene
