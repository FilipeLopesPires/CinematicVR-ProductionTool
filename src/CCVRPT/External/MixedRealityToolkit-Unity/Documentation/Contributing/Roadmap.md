## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will require Unity 2018.4.x

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. MRTK will also support the latest non-beta (ex: 2020.1) tech branch version of Unity, at the time at which MRTK was released.
