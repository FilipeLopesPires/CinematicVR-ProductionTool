![MRTK logo](../Documentation/Images/MRTK_Logo_Rev.png)

The MRTK is available via the following methods. For feedback on these methods, or to request an additional distribution method, please [file an issue on Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/new/choose)

## Unity asset downloadable from the MRTK GitHub site

You can download the packaged [Unity assets from here](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) for importing into your project.

There are two Unity packages available for each release:

### Foundation

This package contains the MRTK itself and all of the code and materials needed to build Mixed Reality experiences.

### Examples

This is an optional package which contains example scenes and samples. This package is dependent on the Foundation package.

## GitHub submodule (advanced users)

For those who would like to contribute to the MRTK or prefer to have the latest code in their project, there is another way to get access to the latest and greatest of the Mixed Reality Toolkit, be it the Release code or the in-progress development of the project.

[Stephen Hodgson has provided a full guide](https://www.rageagainstthepixel.com/expert-import-mrtk/) for how to use Git Submodules to download and synchronize the toolkit in to your project.
