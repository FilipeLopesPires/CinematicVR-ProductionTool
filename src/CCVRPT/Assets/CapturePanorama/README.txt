Unity Script: 360 Panorama Capture
Version 1.3 - 2015 August 2 (Unity 5.1.2f1)

Captures a 360-degree panorama of the player's in-game surroundings and saves/uploads it for later viewing.

Requirements: This plugin currently requires Unity 5.x and a system supporting compute shaders. On PC, compute shaders require DirectX 11, Windows Vista or later, and a recent GPU capable of Shader Model 5.0.

CAPTURING 360 IMAGES
--------------------

1. Create an empty game object and add the Capture Panorama script (CapturePanorama.cs) to it.
2. Under Edit->Project Settings->Player->Other Settings->Optimization, set "Api Compatibility Level" from ".NET 2.0 Subset" to ".NET 2.0". If you don't do this, the script will work in editor but not in builds.
3. If your application is a VR application using the old Oculus VR plugin, uncomment the line "#define OVR_SUPPORT" at the top of CapturePanorama.cs. If you are using Unity native VR support (with or without Oculus Utils), this is unnecessary.
4. Run your application. Press P to capture a panorama. A sound will play and the screen will fade to black. When it completes, a second sound will play and an 8192x4096 PNG file will be saved in the application directory. You can capture programmatically with CaptureScreenshotAsync().
5. When you're ready, check the "Upload image" property to automatically upload all screenshots to the VRCHIVE panorama sharing website (http://alpha.vrchive.org).

If the procedure does not complete as expected, check the "Enable Debugging" property on the Capture Panorama script, build and run the application, and then send the resulting image if any and "output_log.txt" file from your data directory to the developer (eVRydayVR@gmail.com).

RECORDING 360 VIDEOS
--------------------

As of version 1.2, the "Capture Every Frame" option can be used to create 360 videos suitable for uploading to providers such as YouTube and Vrideo, or for viewing in Virtual Desktop or Gear VR. Steps follow.

Preparation:
* Make sure your application is able to run correctly when "Time.captureFramerate" is set to your desired video frame rate. Modify code which depends on the real clock time, e.g. waiting for a certain amount of time to pass, or waiting for audio events to complete, to instead use Time.deltaTime in Update().
* If you wish to capture gameplay and do not want to play the game at reduced frame rate during recording, implementing a replay system is recommended. This will also be useful for capturing the audio below.

Capture:

We will capture an image file for each frame of the video.

1. Check "Capture Every Frame" and enter the desired frame for capture in "Frame Rate".
2. The "BMP" image format provides the fastest capture. "PNG" will use less disk space.
3. Set "Save Image Path" to a fast disk with sufficient capacity for the raw video frames.
4. Set "Panorama Width" to the desired width of your video. Test your playback environment to ensure it supports the video size. Typically mono uses 4096 or 3840 and stereo uses 2048, 2160, 2880, or 3048.
5. Enable "Use Gpu Transform". Disable "Save Cubemap" unless you want cube map images for each frame.
6. For highest quality with slower encoding, increase "Ssaa Factor" to 2, 3, or 4.
7. Start the application and use the capture hotkey ("P" by default) to toggle between capturing and not capturing. You can also programmatically call StartCaptureEveryFrame() and StopCaptureEveryFrame().
8. Run the same scene again at normal speed and use any recording software to separately record the audio.

Creating video:

Install ffmpeg, add it to your path, and save the included asset "assemble.cmd" batch file with your image sequence.

Example invocation of this script from the command line:

assemble Test_2015-07-24_06-42-00-045_ bmp test.mp4 60 18 ultrafast

The parameters are:
* The prefix and extension of each filename (e.g. in this case the filenames were of the form "Test_2015-07-24_06-42-00-045_000001.bmp");
* The output filename;
* The output frame rate (should match the frame rate set during capture);
* The CRF quality, typical range 14 for very good with large file to 24 for mediocre with small file;
* The encoding preset which trades off encoding time and quality, with "ultrafast" producing the largest file the most quickly. This also avoids certain encoding failures.

Alternatively, in Adobe Premiere Pro you can import the sequence directly using these instructions:

https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-still-images.html#import_numbered_still_image_sequences_as_video_clips

Once the video is created, add the audio track and edit as desired. For viewing in Virtual Desktop on Windows 8, be sure to render the final video at H.264 Level 5.1. For viewing on Gear VR, ensure no dimension exceeds 2160.

Encoding during capture will be added in future versions.

REFERENCE
---------

Properties on the Capture Panorama script:

* Panorama Name: Used as the prefix of the saved image filename. If "Upload Images" is enabled, this will appear in the title of the image on the web.

* Quality Setting: Selects which of the quality settings (under Project Settings->Quality) to use during capture. Highest is recommended. Default is to use the player's current setting.

* Capture Key (default "P"): the key to press to capture a 360 screenshot. If you wish to handle your own input, set this to "None" and invoke the CaptureScreenshotAsync() method from your script. If "Capture Every Frame" is enabled, this start and stop capturing of the image sequence.

* Image Format (default PNG): Determines what format(s) to save/upload the image file in. JPEG produces smaller filesize but is much lower quality. BMP is faster to save than PNG but larger.

* Capture Stereoscopic (default false): Captures a top/bottom (over/under) image suitable for stereoscopic (3D) viewing. May produce artifacts. Be sure to set Panorama Width, Interpupillary Distance, and Num Circle Points appropriately when enabling this option.

* Interpupillary Distance (stereoscopic only): Distance between the eye pupils of the viewer in Unity units. Defaults to average IPD in meters from U.S. Army survey.

* Num Circle Points (at least 8, stereoscopic only): Determines at how many points to capture the surroundings. Smaller values are faster while larger values reduce ghosting/doubling artifacts on nearby objects. A good starting point is Panorama Width divided by 32. Smaller values also counterintuitively require more graphics memory, while larger values require less.

* Panorama Width (between 4 and 23800, default 8192): Determines width of the resulting panorama image. Height of the image will be half this in mono mode, or equal to this in stereo mode. Typical reasonable values are 4096 and 8192. Need not be a power of two. If this is too large, black bars may appear in output images, indicating graphics memory has been exhausted.

* Anti Aliasing (default 8): Sets the MSAA anti-aliasing quality to use during rendering. Set to 1 if using deferred rendering.

* Ssaa Factor (default 1): Set to a larger value such as 2, 3, or 4 to render at a higher resolution and then downsample to produce the final image. Produces superior anti-aliasing at a large performance cost. In stereoscopic mode, Ssaa Factor > 1 uses more graphics memory.

* Save Image Path: Directory where screenshots will be saved. If blank, the root application directory will be used.

* Save Cubemap (default off): Check to save the six captured cubemap images to disk. Some viewing software can view these directly. Will increase capture time.

In stereoscopic mode this option will save all captured camera images (stereo cubemaps are not yet supported). The images saved will be first the bottom and top images, then for each circle point it will save 2 images, one turned left 45 degrees and one turned right 45 degrees. Then again for each circle point it will save 2 images, one turned up 45 degrees and one turned down 45 degrees. The viewing circle has diameter equal to IPD; the points are equally distributed starting at Z positive.

* Upload Images (default off): Check to automatically publish panorama screenshots to VRCHIVE for sharing with others immediately after taking them. Visit alpha.vrchive.com to view them. Panoramas are currently uploaded anonymously (not under a user account).

* Use Default Orientation (default off): Resets the camera to the default (directly forward) rotation/orientation before taking the screenshot. May interfere with correct compositing if you have multiple cameras with different rotations. In VR applications, this is usually unnecessary because the headset orientation is used instead to correct the camera orientation.

* Use Gpu Transform (default on): Specifies whether to use the fast GPU-based shader to convert the captured cubemap to the final equirectangular image.

* Cpu Milliseconds Per Frame: When "Use Gpu Transform" is disabled, this will determine the number of CPU milliseconds to spend each frame on processing the panorama.

* Capture Every Frame (default off): When enabled, the Capture Key will start and stop the capturing of every frame to an image sequence.

* Frame Rate (default 30): Sets the frame rate used during capturing when Capture Every Frame is enabled. Determines what Time.captureFramerate will be set to.

* Max Frames To Record: If nonzero, will automatically stop after capturing this many frames.

* Frame Number Digits: When Capture Every Frame is enabled, this determines the number of digits to use for the frame number in the filenames of the image sequence (default 6). If these digits are exceeded, more digits will be used as needed.

* Start Sound: The sound played at the beginning of panorama processing. May be None.

* Done Sound: The sound played at the end of panorama processing. May be None.

* Fade During Capture: Whether to fade the screen to a solid color during capture. Helps to reduce simulator sickness, especially if Panorama Width is large. 

* Fade Time: How quickly to fade in/out. Affects total time needed for capture. A value of zero is not currently supported.

* Fade Color: Solid color to fade the screen to during capture.

* Fade Material: Material that will be placed in front of the camera during fade.

* Enable Debugging: Shows debugging logs and time-to-capture on the console.

CONFIG FILE
-----------

The ReadPanoConfig script allows users to modify panorama capture parameters in a build without modifying the source Unity project. To use it:

1. Add the ReadPanoConfig.cs script to the same object as the CapturePanorama.cs script.
2. After building, the first time the application is run, it will create "CapturePanorama.ini" in the data directory of the build, with settings initially equal to the settings specified in the Inspector for the Capture Panorama script.
3. To modify settings, modify the .ini file and restart the application.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
-----------------

To extend the tool as needed for your application, you can subclass CapturePanorama.CapturePanorama and override virtual methods:

* OnCaptureStart(): Called at the very beginning of each capture
* GetCaptureCameras(): Allows you to control the set of cameras rendered to produce the view
* BeforeRenderPanorama(): Called right before rendering camera views
* AfterRenderPanorama(): Called right after rendering camera views

You can also provide your own MonoBehavior event handlers such as Start(), Update(), Awake(), etc. and then have them call the superclass version using "base.Start()", "base.Update()" etc. The use of subclassing will ease upgrading when future versions of the script are released.

In scenes using the OVR plugin, the left eye will be used by default as the point of rendering.

The package supports scenes with multiple cameras or OVR camera rigs, each with different culling masks. They will be composited based on depth to reproduce the player's view.

In some cases the stereo camera may clip into surrounding objects. Reduce near clip or move the camera farther away to alleviate this.

As of version 1.3 camera image effects will be reproduced.

If you need to determine if a panorama capture is in process (e.g. to wait for the capture to complete), you can check the "Capturing" property.
